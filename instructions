OOP Exercise 1: Create a Class with instance attributes
Write a Python program to create a Vehicle class with max_speed 
and mileage instance attributes.

OOP Exercise 2: Create a Vehicle class without any variables and methods
You would probably comment this out this is just to confirm 
if you can great a class with no attribute and methods


OOP Exercise 3: Create a child class Bus that will inherit all 
of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class

OOP Exercise 4: Class Inheritance
Given:
Create a Bus class that inherits from the Vehicle class.
Give the capacity argument of Bus.seating_capacity() a default value of 50.
Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class.

You can use the same bus class from exercise 3


OOP Exercise 5: Define a property that must have the same value for 
every class instance (object)
Define a class attribute”color” with a default value white. I.e., 
Every Vehicle should be white.


OOP Exercise 6: Class Inheritance
Given:
Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. 
The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. 
If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full 
fare as a maintenance charge.
 So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = 
 total fare + 10% of the total fare.

Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500.
 You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.
Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class. We need to access the 
parent class from inside a method of a child class.

OOP Exercise 8: Determine if School_bus is also an instance of the Vehicle class
Make sure you solve each exercise in seperate files but you can copy 
add paste similar stuff
Make a repository and push your code on there and submit latest by saturday 12pm
